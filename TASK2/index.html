          <b>Thomas Stanley Holland </b>(born 1 June 1996) is an English actor.
          His accolades include a British Academy Film Award, three Saturn
          Awards, a Guinness World Record and an appearance on the Forbes 30
          Under 30 Europe list. Some publications have called him one of the
          most popular actors of his generation.[a]
          <br />
          <br />
          Holland's career began at age nine when he enrolled in a dancing
          class, where a choreographer noticed him and arranged for him to
          audition for a role in Billy Elliot the Musical at London's Victoria
          Palace Theatre. After two years of training, he secured a supporting
          part in 2008 and was upgraded to the title role that year, which he
          played until 2010. Holland made his film debut in the disaster drama
          The Impossible (2012) as a teenage tourist trapped in a tsunami, for
          which he received a London Film Critics Circle Award for Young British
          Performer of the Year. After this, Holland decided to pursue acting as
          a full-time career, appearing in How I Live Now (2013) and playing
          historical figures in the film In the Heart of the Sea (2015) and the
          miniseries Wolf Hall (2015).

          Holland achieved international recognition playing Spider-Man/Peter
          Parker in six Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) superhero films,
          beginning with Captain America: Civil War (2016). The following year,
          Holland received the BAFTA Rising Star Award and later became the
          youngest actor to play a title role in an MCU film in Spider-Man:
          Homecoming. The sequels Far From Home (2019) and No Way Home (2021)
          each grossed more than $1 billion worldwide, and the latter became the
          highest-grossing film of the year. During this period, Holland gained
          recognition for playing darker roles in the crime dramas The Devil All
          the Time (2020) and Cherry (2021). Holland has additionally directed
          the short film Tweet (2015) and voiced roles in computer-animated
          features, including Onward (2020).

        At age nine, Holland began dancing at a hip hop class at Nifty Feet Dance School in Wimbledon, where he performed with
        his school group at the 2006 Richmond Dance Festival. There, he was spotted by choreographer Lynne Page, an associate to
        Peter Darling, choreographer of Billy Elliot the Musical. Page arranged an audition for Holland, where the musical's
        director Stephen Daldry thought that he "had great potential and was a very natural actor".[17] After two years of
        training in ballet, tap dancing and acrobatics,[9] Holland won the role of Michael Caffrey, the protagonist's best
        friend, and made his debut performance at the West End's Victoria Palace Theatre in June 2008.[18] During his time
        performing in the musical, Holland learned gymnastics.[19] Holland says when his peers at school found out about his
        dancing activities, they started bullying him.[13]

    Holland appeared in four episodes of BBC Two's historical miniseries Wolf Hall (2015), as Gregory Cromwell, son of the
    protagonist Thomas Cromwell played by Mark Rylance.[35] He directed Tweet (2015), a 3-minute short film about a young
    man building a birdhouse with his grandfather;[23] Holland later expressed an interest in directing feature films in his
    40s.[8] Also in 2015, Holland co-starred as the teenage sailor Thomas Nickerson in Ron Howard's historical
    adventure-drama In the Heart of the Sea. The film is based on the namesake 2000 non-fiction book about the sinking of
    the American whaling ship Essex in 1820. In preparation, he and co-stars, including Chris Hemsworth, lost significant
    weight, consuming 500–1,000 calories a day. Holland performed most of his stunts in the film.[36] In the Heart of the
    Sea received mixed reviews from critics, and grossed $93 million against a $100 million budget.[37][38] Brian Truitt of
    the USA Today wrote that Holland "does a good job".[39]

    Holland reprised his role as Spider-Man in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and its follow-up Avengers: Endgame (2019),
    which were filmed back-to-back.[68] The pictures each earned more than $2 billion,[69] and Endgame briefly became the
    highest-grossing film of all time.[b] Holland followed with the sequel Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), which widely
    received positive reviews and became the first Spider-Man film to earn $1 billion, finishing as the fourth-highest
    grosser of 2019.[71][72] Ben Travis of Empire magazine found Holland "a note-perfect Spider-Man — still funnier and more
    believably teenage" than Maguire and Garfield who previously portrayed the character. Travis wrote, "Holland never loses
    the ebullient spark that makes him one of the MCU's most endearing figures."[73] Holland received a third consecutive
    Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor for Far From Home, having previously won for Civil War and
    Homecoming.[74] He voiced roles in the Blue Sky Studios animation Spies in Disguise (2019),[75] the live-action film
    Dolittle (2020), and the Pixar animated film Onward (2020). The last two were with his MCU co-stars Robert Downey Jr.
    and Chris Pratt, respectively.[76][77] Made on lucrative budgets, all three films underperformed at the box-office.
